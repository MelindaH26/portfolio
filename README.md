# My Personal Portfolio Website V1

## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to give some background on myself as a developer and show some of the coding projects I have worked on.

## Tech
The tech stack of this project is very bare bones ... It's currently written in plain HTML, CSS and JS ... Why? I've been developing for such a long time and using frameworks etc that I figured it would be fun to keep it simple and code absolutly everything from scratch. While this may not show off the techs I can work with (I will leave this to the Skills and Projects sections of the website) it shows that I know how to design and code from scratch.

## Scope and Future Updates
This is just the first version of this website. I have a number of other improvements and additions I'd like to add but it was out of scope for the first version of this site as I want to get back to my study and other projects.

**Some potential improvments and additions include:**
- Addition of more projects.
- Project pop-ups or pages that show more detailed information on the proccess and build for that project.
- CSS and JS minification and linting.
- Sometime furthur down the line potentially rebuilding this project in React or another framework. 
- The addition of a blog. I am unsure if the Blog would be part of this website or it's own website.
